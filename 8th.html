In the beautiful land of Vrindavan, Krishna, the charming cowherd, grew up spreading love and joy. Meanwhile, in Barsana, King Vrishabhanu and Queen Kirti were blessed with a divine daughter, Radha. But from birth, Radha never opened her eyes, leaving everyone worried.One day, Yashoda took little Krishna to Vrishabhanu’s palace. As Krishna’s tiny hands touched baby Radha, a miracle happened—Radha opened her eyes for the first time and saw Krishna. It was as if she had been waiting for him all along.

The melody was so enchanting that the Gopis (cowherd women) of Vrindavan, leaving behind their homes, families, and all worldly ties, rushed towards him, drawn by the divine call of love.Krishna welcomed them with a smile, and in that sacred moment, he multiplied himself so that each Gopi felt his undivided presence. In the heart of the forest, under the celestial sky, began the Rāsleela, a divine dance where Krishna and the Gopis moved in perfect harmony. Their love was pure, free from desire, a devotion that transcended the material world.As the dance reached its peak, the Gopis, in their pride, thought Krishna belonged only to them. To humble them, Krishna suddenly disappeared. The Gopis, heartbroken, searched for him everywhere, calling out his name in longing. Finally, when their love turned into pure surrender, Krishna reappeared, showering them with divine bliss.The Rāsleela was not just a dance—it was the highest form of devotion (Bhakti), where the soul merges with the Divine. Even today, it symbolizes selfless love, surrender, and eternal union with God. 💖✨."},

The villagers, frightened, rushed to Krishna for help. With a divine smile, Krishna effortlessly lifted the massive Govardhan Hill on his little finger, providing shelter to all. For seven days and nights, he held it up while the storm raged.Defeated, Indra finally realized Krishna’s divine power and bowed before him, seeking forgiveness. Krishna, ever merciful, forgave Indra and taught him that true devotion lies in humility, not pride.Since then, the people of Vrindavan celebrate Govardhan Puja, honoring Krishna as the Divine Protector and nurturer of all beings. 🌿🙏✨"},
